Mobs
====

Spider
######
Works recursive, if it can go left it goes over and over, if it can't go it changes
its direction and tries again. For handling endless loops, if all sides are closed,
function returns.
When it dies it only converts dirts to diamond.

Monster
#######
It looks to player position and tries to move. If player stands diagonal to monster,
monster tries both ways to move.
When it dies it converts all blocks around except player and border to diamond.
